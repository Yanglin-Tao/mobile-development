Final Project - Mobile Game
The Final is a fully flushed out large scale mobile game project. Working in teams, 
design a game around the interface of the medium. See how far you can explore the 
input options of mobile devices, such as touch, swipes, rotation, geolocation, and haptic 
feedback. The project can be a continuation of one of the previous assignments or be a 
wholly original work. Milestones and a groups ability to self organize will be critical. 
Proposals must be approved by the instructor. Final Betas will be presented and 
playtested at the 2-week mark. Along with the itch page, the final should also be 
accompanied by a video trailer and a promotional website.
